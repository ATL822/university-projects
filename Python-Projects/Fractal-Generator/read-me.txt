Fractal Renderer User Information

To run this program
1) Prepare your python environment by installing the necessary libraries
	- use the command 'pip install pygame'
2) Run the main.py script in your Python environment


Using the program
1) Upon running the script an interface will launch and prompt you to enter two values
	- these values will be used to calculate the fractal that is displayed
2) Submit your values using the 'Submit and Render' button
	- the script will being creating the image 
	- when finished the rendered the image to a new display window
3) The Image display an be closed using the 'Close Display Window' button
	- After the display window is closed new values can be entered and a new image rendered
4) To exit the program close the display window and press the 'x' at the top right of the user interface


Important notes:
	- You processor will effect how fast the images render
	- The number of processors is hard coded to the value of 32 and is labeled as 'num_workers'
		- to change this, the value at line 69 in the fractal_utils.py script must be updated
